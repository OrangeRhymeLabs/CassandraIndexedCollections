Indexed Collections for Cassandra

This is an implementation of the indexing technique described here:

http://www.anuff.com/2010/07/secondary-indexes-in-cassandra.html

This required Hector, the Java client for Cassandra (https://github.com/rantav/hector), to run.

It also uses Cassandra Composite Types (https://github.com/edanuff/CassandraCompositeType) and
requires that the CompositeType comparer be installed in the running Cassandra instance.

While some of this has been in use in another project, this implementation was largely
created from scratch, so although the technique works very well, this code might not.
