Indexed Collections for Cassandra

This is an implementation of the indexing technique described here:

http://www.anuff.com/2010/07/secondary-indexes-in-cassandra.html

This requires Hector, the Java client for Cassandra (https://github.com/rantav/hector), to run.

It also uses Cassandra Composite Types (https://github.com/edanuff/CassandraCompositeType) and
requires that the CompositeType comparer be installed in the running Cassandra instance.

This is a simplified version of a more complex indexing scheme thats been in used
for some time now as part of a large project.  However, this simplified implementation was
largely created from scratch and hasn't been extensively tested.
